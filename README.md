All quotations from Chapter 10, "The Pensive Spectator" in *Death at 24x a second* by Laura Mulvey:

> "By halting the image or repeating sequences, the spectator can dissolve the fiction so that the time or registration can come to the fore." (p. 184)

> "The psychosexual dimension of visual pleasure meets the human psyche's anxiety at the shadow of passing time and the inevitability of death" (p. 191)

> "The 'aesthetics of delay' revolve around the process of stilling the film but also repitition, the return to certain moments or sequences, as well as slowing down the illusion of natural movement" (p. 192)

> "the compulsion to repeat" (p. 192)

> "Not only do the uncanny qualities of the photographic index persist, but there is also an even more acute sense that time cannot be grapsed and that, in the cinema, 'time that doubles life' returns all the more clearly 'brushed by death'." (p. 196)


## About the data

Nearly every day, the Google Photos application on my phone sends me a notification about images I created on this day, in the past. When I receive these notifications, I revisit where I've been and when. I zoom in on these reminded images, and re-photographing them by making screenshots of their details. These screenshots are new compositions of old things.
